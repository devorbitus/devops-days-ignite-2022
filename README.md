A Terraform repo for setting up a side project in a secure way for as little cost as possible

## Where is the code?
In all honesty, I kind of ran out of time to complete this before my talk but I plan to finish it in the coming days/weeks. If you feel this is important to you and would like to poke me digitally with a stick you can feel free to create an issue up above and let me know the interest and I can try to prioritize completion.
